Coding Project
โข If you choose to code, you will write small code that displays the major difference between two
languages in two different paradigms.
Avoid codes like hello world or greatest of two/three numbers.
Program or codes that are Acceptable:
o Program to check if a string is palindrome or not.
o Reverse words in a given String.
o Program for n-th Fibonacci number
o Program for factorial of a number
o Program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval.
o Searching and Sorting Programs
Submission guidelines:
o The codes should be well commented. Comment effectively so that it is easier to
understand. For each concept, include a description.
o You can submit the codes in a zip file on blackboard.
ยง ReadMe file: Mention the programming language and compilers used.
o You can also code your program in GitHub. In the blackboard submit URL to your GitHub account.

#In this project I will be comparing the difference in programming paradigms between Java and C++
Each code is supplied above and is well commented using recursion.

  Java Factorial Computing using Recursion Desrciption
If you look at the way the syntax is written for java script it is every similar to c++ but there are key diferences.
Java unlike c++ the language can be interpreted and/or compiled.
