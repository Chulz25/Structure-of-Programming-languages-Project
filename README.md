Coding Project
โข If you choose to code, you will write small code that displays the major difference between two
languages in two different paradigms.
Avoid codes like hello world or greatest of two/three numbers.
Program or codes that are Acceptable:
o Program to check if a string is palindrome or not.
o Reverse words in a given String.
o Program for n-th Fibonacci number
o Program for factorial of a number
o Program to print all Prime numbers in an Interval.
o Searching and Sorting Programs
Submission guidelines:
o The codes should be well commented. Comment effectively so that it is easier to
understand. For each concept, include a description.
o You can submit the codes in a zip file on blackboard.
ยง ReadMe file: Mention the programming language and compilers used.
o You can also code your program in GitHub. In the blackboard submit URL to your GitHub account.

#In this project I will be comparing the difference in programming paradigms between Java and C++
Each code is supplied above and is well commented using recursion.

  Java Factorial Computing using Recursion Desrciption
If you look at the way the syntax is written for java it is every similar to c++ but there are key diferences.
Java unlike c++ the language can be interpreted and/or compiled.
In the code we first start with a class named Factorial Example, then we start recursion that uses a static integer unlike the c++ program you have to change the value in the code to figure out the factorial. Recurison is discussed further below. To intialize integers like i and fact it is very similar to c++  but when it comes to the print statment its very annoying compared to c++ cout.
We call a function "Factorial(number)" like this in java.

C++ Factorial Computing using Recursion Desricption
Just like java the code is somewhat similar to java but there are some differences. C++ is not memory safe which causes alot of memory errors and crashes to take place in the codes execution. C++ doesnt support threads like Java does. Also C++ has a full pointer support unlike java which has limited pointer support.
If you look at the code we start in the code in main which is different from java. we set a integer n that takes the positiver integer to be factored. We then call the factorial function below which is using recursion then spitting the factorial back in a print statement which is very different from the java print statment its less of a hassle.


You are probably wondering what is recursion?
Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self similar way. So in both programs we call the function inside of its self which is called a recursive call of the function.


Thank you
